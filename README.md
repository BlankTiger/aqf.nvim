# üî≠ Overview

Advanced QuickFix (aqf) - store, edit, swap, filter and keep histories of quickfix lists like a pro. With this plugin you can perform all the mentioned actions in a workflow inspired by [oil.nvim](https://github.com/stevearc/oil.nvim), which means that the main feature of this plugin is being able to edit quickfix lists in a buffer as plain text.

Additionally, with help of [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) you can filter currently edited quickfix list in various ways:
- by file name,
- by match content,
- by file content.

# ‚òëÔ∏è Requirements

- If you want to only use the 'edit quickfix as a buffer' workflow, then you don't have to install any additional things.
- If you want to use all the additional filtering features, then you have to have the following conditions met:
    + [ripgrep](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep) installed,
    + [telescope.nvim](https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim) installed,
